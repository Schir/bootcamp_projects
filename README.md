# About
you know how when you're in school, you've got a bunch of stuff for each of your classes in your binder?
that binder is basically what this repository is. it's a mess of assignments and notes with a couple of dividers and labels to make it easier to figure out what I was doing at any given point in time. 

the basic top-level division on this is: 
- things I wrote for homework, and 
- stuff I did that wasn't explicitly asked for by the app academy open course, but which I did anyway for some reason.

the stuff I did outside the course is filed under the "extracurricular activities" folder, which is then sub-filed according to one of the following conditions:
- helping other people with their homework with comments describing the problem-solving steps, and 
- exploring other programming languages to see what makes them tick

The exercises that the course asked me to do are filed at the top level according to language, with exercises going under which module they fell under in the course.

Additionally in the top level there are two files, progressdoc.txt and progresstester.py. Those are there so I can get a more exact idea of how far along I am in the course. they're not filed in any folder because I don't want to cd two folders deeper every time I want to see where I'm at.
