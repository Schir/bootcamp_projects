Debugging this one was a bit more trouble than you'd think from looking at it.
At the basic level, I just added in <title>, <h1>, and <p> tags in the file, 
but the problem turned out to be that the person was twisting themselves in knots trying to do everything from WSL and getting very confused by the command line.
which, I've been there, I get that. They were asking a lot of the wrong questions and getting very confused because of it.

So I had to kind of go back to basics and explain that WSL is just a directory under the normal filesystem,
and explained how to open Explorer to that directory from there.
I told them to not worry about liverunning extensions or any of that if they're just starting out. Just open the file in Chrome to test things for now.
After helping them get to the directory, they managed to get it working.
