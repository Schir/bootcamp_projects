I want to make a dungeon crawler.

concept: 
    you are an awful wizard, trapped at the bottom of a maze (like wizardry 4).
    you cannot move by yourself, but you can make horrific abominations
    these creatures can evolve with magic reagents obtained by searching the dungeon and fighting explorers who've come looking.

    initially the monster is crappy and bad, as the only reagents you have are things like dust and lint and thread.
    fighting is a losing proposition early game, as your monster sucks ass. 
    you will need to avoid combat and find materials early game.
    as the game progresses you will steamroll an increasing amount of things as you keep grafting on more arms and legs and mouths and the like
    by the time you reach the top floor your monster should be the sort of grotesque creature that would make H.R. Geiger terrified. 
    if this thing gets out it will be A Problem

    materials can then be broken down into raw components, which will let you graft more things onto your monster if it meets the conditions
    for the sake of simplicity, you can only make one monster at a time

    when creatures die, their remains will be placed on the node where they died. these can then be collected, same as any other materials

    to start I think I'll just make some basic text display and a button to move between two rooms
